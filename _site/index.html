<b>SecureMDE 2018:</b> First International Workshop on Security for and by Model-Driven
Engineering. Co-located with the <a href="http://www.staf2018.fr/">STAF'18</a> conference federation, June 25,
Toulouse, France.





<p>
There are at least two ways in which MDE and Security might be beneficially
combined: using MDE to support the development of secure systems and,
integrating security techniques in MDE to give support to new development
scenarios such as collaborative and distributed modeling. In this sense, SecureMDE 2018
will provide a forum for presenting and discussing a wide range of topics
related to the interplay between MDE and Security. </p>

<p>Indeed, MDE has succeeded to play a key role in many critical tasks related to
ICT security. However, new domains such as Internet of Things, Cyber-physical
systems and Blockchain-based technologies stress the limitations of previous
work and pose new challenges to current model-driven security techniques.
Moreover, the increased adoption of MDE in collaborative scenarios highlights
the need for security <b>for</b> MDE itself in order to deal with requirements
such as confidentiality and integrity.</p>

<p> <b>The International Workshop on Security for and by Model-Driven Engineering</b> seeks contributions that provide novel results,  work-in-progress
or experience results on the integration of security tools and techniques in MDE
development. SecureMDE 2018 also looks forward to receiving papers summarizing the
state-of-the art and future vision in the general field of MDE for the
development and analysis of systems with security requirements.
