SecureMDE seeks contributions that provide novel results on the integration of
security tools and techniques in MDE development, as well as work-in-progress or
experience reports that provide insight into early adoption or requirements.
SecureMDE also looks forward to receiving papers summarizing the state-of-the art and
future vision in the general field of MDE for the development and analysis of
systems with security requirements. 

Topics of the workshop will include (among others):

 * Model-driven development of secure software and systems
 * Domain-specific modeling languages (DSML) for secure software
 * Modeling of access control and privacy policies
 * Model-based generation of test cases for security policies
 * Model-based dynamic security adaptation
 * Model-based security reverse-engineering and analysis
 * Model-based security evolution and co-evolution
 * Model-based verification techniques for security properties
 * Threats, vulnerability, and trust modeling
 * Security systems and languages for MDE
 * Cryptography and obfuscation for MDE
 * IP protection for MDE
 * Requirements for/needs in MDE security
 * MDE for Block-chain technologies and Smart contracts 
 * Case studies and experience reports
